# Single Page Application- [SPA](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/single-page-web-apps)

This type of application is mostly used when you want complete Auth to be handled by Auth0 .

SPA is used in most cases where you get a end-to-end functional Login and Signup screen from Auth0. You can change the look and feel of the screens by going to Branding -> Universal Login.

## Important!!
If you are confused between M2M and SPA, always go for SPA because it provides E2E functionality from Auth0 itself. This is why Auth0 is selected as a preference over building your own Auth.
