# Single Page Application - [SPA](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/machine-to-machine-apps)

This type of application is mostly used when you dont want a auth screen from Auth0 and want to do everything using Auth0 APIs.

SPA is used in most cases where you get a end-to-end functional Auth Login and Signup screen.
